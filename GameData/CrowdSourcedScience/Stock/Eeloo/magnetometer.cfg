        EelooInSpaceLow* = A thin sheath of ionized gas around Eeloo is scattering charged particles as they come in. For any relevant purposes, of course, it's not flyable.

        EelooInSpaceHigh* = Well, this icy little guy sure does not have a magnetic field. But the distance is promising for studying solar activity. The heliopause can't be too much farther out, can it? Surely?
