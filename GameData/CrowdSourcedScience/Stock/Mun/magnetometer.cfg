    {
        MunInSpaceLow* = There's at least a tiny bit of still-magnetized material on the Mun's surface which is detectable at this range - signs of the rock's once-active past, likely.

        MunInSpaceHigh* = The farthest reaches of Kerbin's magnetic field give way to stony silence. Or... is that a little bit of noise above the detection limit leaking through...?
