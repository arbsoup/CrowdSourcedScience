    {
        DunaInSpaceLow* = The surface deposits of magnetite here still project their own residual magnetic fields! Something must have gotten them polarized once, when Duna's core was alive. Now if only we had a few billion nukes to warm it up again...

        DunaInSpaceHigh* = Magnetic activity in space around Duna is awfully faint. Not a great sign if you don't enjoy getting blasted by radiation.
