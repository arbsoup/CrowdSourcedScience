        JoolInSpaceLow* = The boom arm might as well be bending with the incredible amount of magnetism here. It isn't, because it's not made of ferromagnetic materials, but still.

        JoolInSpaceHigh* = Even from millions of kilometers out, Jool's fearsome magnetic dynamo looms over everything. The harsh spray of charged particles in its radiation belts is equally intimidating.
