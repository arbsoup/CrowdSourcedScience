        LaytheInSpaceLow* = You try putting a magnet by the magnetometer, just to make sure it's working right.
        LaytheInSpaceLow* = You wish you had a compass. The magnetometer won't tell you which way is up.
        LaytheInSpaceLow* = After a bit of trouble, the instrument starts working again and cheerily spits out lots of information on Laythe's complex semi-active core dynamo. You have exchanged boredom at it not working for boredom at the science team babbling on and on.

        LaytheInSpaceHigh* = Jool's magnetic field seems to be protecting Laythe from the worst of Kerbol's wrath.
        LaytheInSpaceHigh* = Solar charged-particle readings here are fortunately low. Joolian charged-particle readings, on the other hand...
