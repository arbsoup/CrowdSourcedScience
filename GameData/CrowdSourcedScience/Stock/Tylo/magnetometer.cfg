        TyloInSpaceLow* = The readouts here are still interesting, if not tremendously high-energy. Tylo's huge mass is not exactly enough to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Still working on it.

        TyloInSpaceHigh* = Jool's magnetic field buckles as you approach. Tylo's huge core, perhaps tidally warmed by its parent, is producing its own magnetism.
